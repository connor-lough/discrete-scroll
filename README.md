This small utility fixes macOS's unnecessary scroll acceleration.
It runs in the background
and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the wheel.

## Supported versions

As of April 2024, this fix works on macOS versions 10.9â€“14.0.

## Installation

You may download the binary [here](https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll/releases/download/v0.1.1u/DiscreteScroll.zip).
It needs to be run each time you boot.
If you want this to be automatic, do the following:

1. On macOS 13.0 and later, go to `System Settings > General > Login Items`;
otherwise, go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items`.
2. Add `DiscreteScroll` to the list.

If you want to undo the effect you may launch Activity Monitor,
search for `DiscreteScroll` and force it to quit.
